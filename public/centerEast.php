								<p>"My son has been in Creative Child Care since he was a tiny toddler in diapers. Now he is a bright, active preschooler. The community at Creative Child Care has become like an extended family to us. They all are genuinely interested in providing my son with a top-notch educational experience. We have been so happy with all of his teachers. They are such nice people and do their job with grace and humor. They have taught my son so much! Not just verbal and math skills, but social skills and manners. I feel blessed to have my son in such a wonderful learning environment."
