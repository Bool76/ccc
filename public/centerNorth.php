								<p>"I recommend Creative Child Care to any parent who wants a developmentally nourishing environment for their child. The staff are amazing, they are caring and respect the diversity of all families. Creative Child Care is welcoming to all and they support families and children with a range of programming and community supports. As a parent who has experienced several child care settings with the county, I can confidently say Creative Child Care surpasses other options for child care. As an elementary educator, I have witnessed how the center prepares students to be at the top of their academic development range."</p>

								<p>"I have been bringing my children to Creative Child Care since 2011. The children are in a safe place and everyone who works here is very kind.  At this center, you feel like you are part of a large family. I always recommend this place to my friends."</p>

								<p>"Creative Child Care has been home to my children for the past 4 years. My children love going there. The staff and teachers have been great in making sure my children are learning and having fun. I can take homework in for them and the teachers are more than happy to make sure it gets done. They have activities like swimming, water play, zoo day and my youngest daughter loves Bailey day. I would recommend Creative Childcare to any parent.  You can be sure that when you drop your children off, they are in the best hands possible."
