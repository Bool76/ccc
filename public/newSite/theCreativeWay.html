National studies confirm that a high-quality child care program plays a valuable role in shaping a child's future during those crucial early years.

															At Creative Child Care children are grouped in classes according to age and ability. Scheduled developmentally appropriate activities include reading readiness and language arts, outdoor and large muscle play, music and rhythms, social and nature sciences, math concepts, creative art and creative dramatics, free play, computer training.  Activities are designed to arouse the child's natural curiosity and allow him to learn through exploration and experimentation. The daily routine includes a balance of active and quiet play as well as opportunities for both solitary and group time. Although we allow room for some flexibility and variation in the schedule, our days are carefully planned to provide a consistent program tailored to the needs of the children in each class. We find that such consistency adds to each child&acirc;��s sense of security with children knowing what to expect and when to expect it.

																	Creative Child Care's purpose is to educate the whole child by offering experiences that will help children meet their social, emotional, educational, and physical needs. We view curriculum as "everything that happens within the classroom" regardless of the age of the child. All Classrooms utilize "Creative Curriculum&Acirc;&reg;"" as a foundation for our learning experiences. Creative Curriculum&Acirc;&reg;, aligns with the Ohio Early Learning Development Standards and is used in all our centers. Children learn through this research based curriculum allowing active and developmentally appropriate participation while encouraging cognitive, social/emotional, physical and language development of each child. This environment is further enriched by interactions with peers and supportive adults allowing children to celebrate their accomplishments.
															</p>
															<p>
																Creative Curriculum&Acirc;&reg; goes by the child&acirc;��s interest meaning the children learn through play.  Play and investigation are central to our program as how cognitive learning, socialization and creativity develops. Children are given the opportunity to make choices, express ideas and theories, and act upon their understandings within a well-defined learning environment. Within each classroom, a variety of materials and media are available for the children to graphically represent their knowledge and understanding and express their ideas. It is the teacher's responsibility to acknowledge the children&acirc;��s interest and create lesson plans while meeting the curriculum goals set by The Ohio Department of Education and to develop individual child goals to support skill progression towards mastery.
															</p>
															<p>
																Creative Curriculum&Acirc;&reg; is the foundation for the learning experience, and children can explore at their own pace in areas that interest them.
