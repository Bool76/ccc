													Social and medical researchers agree that from ages 1 to 6 human beings learn and develop more than at any other time in their lives. National studies confirm that a high-quality child care program plays a valuable role in shaping a child's future during those crucial early years. There is conclusive evidence that children stimulated by developmentally appropriate experiences, and enriched by interactions with peers and supportive adults are better prepared for formal education and a productive adulthood.

														<a href="http://www.earlychildhoodohio.org/sutq.stm" target="_blank">Step Up To Quality</a> (SUTQ) is a five-star quality rating system administered by the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services (ODJFS) and the Ohio Department of Education (ODE). All four Creative Child Care centers are quality rated through Step-Up-To-Quality!  This means that all children enrolled with us participate in a learning and development program where the level of quality exceeds Ohio's child care licensing standards. Becoming star rated and maintaining your stars is not easy to accomplish. We are proud of the leadership and staff at each of our centers, not only for their hard work every day but also for their commitment to providing children with the best care possible. Below are some of the ways our centers provide increased quality of care:
													</p>
													<p>
														<ul>
															<li>
																The administrators and teachers have higher education qualifications. These qualifications benefit your child's development and learning.
															</li>
															<li>
																The administrators and teachers complete 20 or more hours of specialized training every two years. The administrators and teaching staff are committed to expanding their knowledge and skills to better support your child's development and learning.
															</li>
															<li>
																Teachers develop lesson plans that support each child's growth. Teachers plan intentional and purposeful activities and experiences that meet the needs, interests and abilities of children and supports them where they are in their development.
															</li>
															<li>
																The program completes assessments to evaluate and improve the learning experience. Regular assessments are done with your child to help keep track of their growth over time. This lets teachers adjust how they offer experiences to your child daily.
															</li>
															<li>
																The program builds relationships with families. Teachers and families work together to create goals for your child and share information about your child's progress. We offer events to involve families in their child's learning and development.
															</li>
														</ul>
													</p>
													<p>
														A high-quality program is important because 90% of brain development occurs by the time your child is 6 years old! For more information please go to <a href="http://www.earlychildhoodohio.org/sutq.stm" target="_blank">www.earlychildhoodohio.org</a>.

															At Creative Child Care children are grouped in classes according to age and ability. Scheduled developmentally appropriate activities include reading readiness and language arts, outdoor and large muscle play, music and rhythms, social and nature sciences, math concepts, creative art and creative dramatics, free play, computer training.  Activities are designed to arouse the child's natural curiosity and allow him to learn through exploration and experimentation. The daily routine includes a balance of active and quiet play as well as opportunities for both solitary and group time. Although we allow room for some flexibility and variation in the schedule, our days are carefully planned to provide a consistent program tailored to the needs of the children in each class. We find that such consistency adds to each child's sense of security with children knowing what to expect and when to expect it.

We encourage the satisfaction of curiosity by providing opportunity with a safe environment for children to observe, ask questions, experiment, make mistakes and find the answers for themselves. Children need to engage in relationships with both adults and peers to grow and develop. By utilizing the following strategies, our staff will provide a positive approach that is responsive to the individual needs of the child.

																	Creative Child Care's purpose is to educate the whole child by offering experiences that will help children meet their social, emotional, educational, and physical needs. We view curriculum as "everything that happens within the classroom" regardless of the age of the child. All Classrooms utilize "Creative Curriculum&reg;" as a foundation for our learning experiences. Creative Curriculum&reg;, aligns with the Ohio Early Learning Development Standards and is used in all our centers. Children learn through this research based curriculum allowing active and developmentally appropriate participation while encouraging cognitive, social/emotional, physical and language development of each child. This environment is further enriched by interactions with peers and supportive adults allowing children to celebrate their accomplishments.
															</p>
															<p>
																Creative Curriculum&reg; goes by the child's interest meaning the children learn through play. Play and investigation are central to our program as how cognitive learning, socialization and creativity develops. Children are given the opportunity to make choices, express ideas and theories, and act upon their understandings within a well-defined learning environment. Within each classroom, a variety of materials and media are available for the children to graphically represent their knowledge and understanding and express their ideas. It is the teacher's responsibility to acknowledge the children's interest and create lesson plans that meet Ohio Early Learning standards and to develop individual child goals to support skill progression towards mastery.
															</p>
															<p>
																Creative Curriculum&reg; is the foundation for the learning experience, and children can explore at their own pace in areas that interest them.
