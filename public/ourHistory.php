						<p>
								Creative Child Care, Inc. was incorporated in 1970 with one center located on the north side of Columbus, Ohio. Within two years Creative had built another center on the east side of Columbus.  Between 1973 and 1976 three more centers were acquired by Creative Child Care, Inc.
						</p>
						<p>
								The two original principal owners of Creative Child Care, Inc., Richard (Dick) Sensenbrenner and Elizabeth (Libby) Schilling, were lifelong residents of Columbus and had many years of business, government and Early Childhood Education knowledge and experience between them. The company was approached to go National but Dick and Libby felt strongly about being present in all their centers on a regular basis.
						</p>
						<p>
								Creative Child Care, Inc. has served children and families in our communities for over forty-six years.  Often, when a community changes, businesses, including many child care centers, move out and on to more affluent neighborhoods. However, we are here to stay and are proud that we have become an "institution" within the communities we serve. Families know and trust us, in fact, we have parents who attended Creative as children who are now entrusting us with their own children.
						</p>
						<p>
								In 2012 Creative Child Care, Inc. completely renovated our West location and expanded the building to include 7 classrooms. The expansion allowed us to serve the west side with one site so the West Broad center was closed and their families were welcomed at Westland, now known as the West Center.
						</p>
						<p>
								Today the Company is still a family owned and operated business. In 2007 Dick announced his retirement and his son-in-law, Todd Waldron, came on board to run the day-to-day operations of the company. Dick's daughter, Karin, joined her husband in the family business in 2013. As in the past, you can expect to see the owners visible at each center at any given time.
